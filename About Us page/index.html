            <h1> Why we started Vulterm?</h1>
            
             <p>We are a group of entrepreneurs and legal technologist who have discovered that SMEs are having a tough time getting their 
                policies and terms of use right. There has been issues of incomplete T&C, unreadable and incomprehensive terms of use 
                and so many issues.</p>
                <p> We therefore came together, researched on didgital laws,compile them and finally categorized them based on location and  type of business.</p>
            <p> We have decided to take it further and created the "Per annum Package". This package includes everything from basic you   
                need to know concerning legal issues for your business. We also give you the HTML code, PDF, TXT, DOCX file of your privacy  
                policy and Terms of Service. </p>
